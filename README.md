# Digital Circuit Simulator
Web/Desktop (PC) simulator which is intended for creating logic circuits, their simulations and many different operations in boolean algebra.
## Software functionalities
*Note: this is the initial plan for this software and possibly many other features will be added later.*
* Creating logic circuits - User can choose between many standard logic gates, and the ones that he has created and connect them in the main panel.
* Simulation - Digital circuit that has been made by the user can be tested (simulated). User will get informations about the logic states from all parts of the circuit.
* Black-Box functionality - This functionality allows users to create their own "standard" circuits which they can use later as one single element.
* Logic conversions:
  * Converting logic functions into logic circuits.
  * Converting logic circuits into logic functions.
* Function minimisation - Returns minimised forms of the entered function.
  * Function minimisation will be possible with these methods: McCluskey method, Quine method, Veitch diagrams (some other methods might also be added later). 
  User will be able to check the 
  step by step solutions of the minimisation process.
* NAND/NOR adjustment - Returns the entered function in its NAND/NOR representation.
